# ATM-simulator-C
 ATM Simulator is a simple mini project developed using C language. It simulates basic ATM operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance enquiry through a menu-driven interface. This project helps in understanding core C concepts such as loops, switch-case, and conditional statements. The program can be executed easily using Cxxdroid on mobile.
